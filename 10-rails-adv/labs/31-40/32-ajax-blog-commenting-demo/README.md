## Overview

AJAX allows a browser to make requests behind the scenes without locking up the browser while waiting for the reply from the server. Ajax uses asynchronous requests as opposed to synchronous requests where the user must wait for the reply before carrying on. This allows the user to carry on using the browser, so improving the user's experience.
