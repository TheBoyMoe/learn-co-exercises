# Pagination With Kaminari Lab

## Objectives

1. Use Kaminari to paginate songs.

## Song Library

In this lab, we're going to augment our song library to paginate our
songs index.

## Instructions

The base models, controllers, views and other files have been provided. There's seed data to get you started, and there are tests for the lab in the `spec` directory.

Since we are adding new features to an existing application, there will
already be some passing tests. Part of your job is to make sure they're
still passing after you're done!

1. Use Kaminari to limit the songs index to 20 songs per page.
2. Add paging controls to the songs index.
3. Ensure tests pass.
4. High five a million angels, 20 at a time.

**Note** There are tests that are already passing.  That's intentional.
