# Receiving API POSTs Lab

## Objectives

  1. Send form via POST request with jQuery.
  2. Create resources from an AJAX POST.
  3. Render and consume JSON responses for created resources.

## Introduction

In this lab, we're going to continue to enhance our product and order
system, this time updating the product creation page to create and
display new products without requiring a refresh or redirect.

The solution for the previous lab has been included for you.

## Instructions

1. Update the `new` product page to submit the form via AJAX POST.
2. Update the product `create` action to render a JSON representation of
   the product after successfully creating it.
3. Display the product details of the newly created product on the `new` page without refreshing or redirecting.
4. Make sure those tests pass!
