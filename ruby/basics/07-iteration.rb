### for loop ###

=begin
Most Ruby programmers don't use the for loop very often, instead 
preferring to use an "each" loop and do iteration. The reason for 
this is that the variables used to iterate in the for loop exist 
outside the for loop, while in other iterators, they exist only 
inside the block of code thatâ€™s running.

the for loop functions like an iterator, working like the #each method

=end

# The following for loop creates a range from 1 to 10 and 
# then passes the value in to the block on each iteration:
for value in 1..10 do
    puts "The current item is: #{value}"
end

# using a for loop with an array
arr = ['alpha', 'bravo', 'charlie', 'delta', 'echo']
for item in arr do
    puts "array item: #{item}"
end

# or
for item in ["Programming", "is", "fun"] do
  puts "The current item is #{item}."
end
