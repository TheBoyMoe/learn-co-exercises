### What are Media Queries

Media Queries allow us to measure the device viewport (screen) size and then adjust our CSS layout and content accordingly so it best suits each size device.

### Syntax

Below is the syntax for writing a media query statement within our CSS code,

```css
@media [not|only] type [and] (expr) [,] â€¦ {
    rules
}
```

We start by using the `@media` keyword followed by the condition statements that will trigger the media query on or off. The logical keywords not or only can optionally be provided to trigger queries for specific devices using `only` or for every device except a particular kind of device using the `not` keyword. These logical keywords are followed by the device type. At the time of writing this the only currently well supported device types are: screen, print, or all (meaning all devices). We can use `and` and `,` to separate conditions. Using `and` requires that both conditions on each side of the `and` are both true in order for the query to trigger on. The `,` stands for "or" meaning that only one of the conditions on either side of the comma has to be true for the query to trigger on. We use condition expressions surrounded by `()` parentheses to set up a condition that must be true in order for the query to trigger on and that will be false for the query to not be triggered. This is followed by a set of `{}` curly braces that enclose the CSS selectors and rules that will be applied when the media query is triggered.

To give better context, let's create a media query that will change a paragraph's text from red to green when the screen size falls below 800px,

```css
/* initial style */
p { color: red; }

/* media query */
@media only screen and (max-width: 800px) {
  p { color: green; }
}
```

Here on line 2 we are writing some intial style that will be applied when our media query is switched off (untriggered). We have set our paragraph to have red text. Then on line 5 we create a media query using `@media` and set it to only trigger for `only screen` screen devices `and` for devices whose screen size is within the condition `(max-width: 800px)`. Here max-width means any screen size whose maximum width is no larger than 800px, or in other words only screens less than 801px. Said another way, this will trigger for devices with screens that are 800px or less. Following the condition is `{}` curly braces which enclose the styles that will be switched on when the condition above is true. In our case on line 6 we will change paragraphs text color to green instead of red. To clarify once more, on devices with screen sizes 800px or less will display paragraphs with green text and on devices larger than 800px we will display paragraphs with red colored text.

For our size conditions we can use the properties min-width, max-width, min-height, and max-height; all refering to the size of the devices viewport (or screen size). Above we looked at max-width, now let's explore min-width,

```css
/* initial style */
p { color: red; }

/* media query */
@media only screen and (min-width: 400px) {
  p { color: green; }
}
```

Here on line 2 we set the default color of paragraphs to red text again. In our media query on line 5 we set the query Meaning the minimum size of the screen must be 400px or above. Said another way, this will not trigger from devices that are below 400px, but will be switched on above 400px.

So, max-width sets a breakpoint that triggers as a screen gets smaller than  the specified size and min-width will trigger when a screen raises above a certain size.

As mentioned prior, we can use the `and` keyword to chain mutliple condition expressions together. Let's look at that example,

```css
/* initial style */
p { color: red; }

/* media query */
@media only screen and (min-width: 400px) and (max-width: 800px) {
  p { color: green; }
}
```

Here we are changing the text color to green only on screens that are between 400px and 800px.

One nice thing about media queries is that they automatically inherit all of the styles written outside of their `{}` braces. So inside the media query we only need to write the css for the properties we wish to change. Later on we will look at some practical ways to use media queries in real life situations within our website.

### At What Size Should I Create Break Points?

Let your content determine where break points should fall. Use Developer Tools and Emulators to discover where your content starts to break down. Then create an appropriate break point (media query at that width) to solve the issue. This will ensure that your content looks good on any and all devices not just the popular ones.

## Summary

- CSS Media Queries provide us a way to alter our CSS at a specific screen sizes.
- The syntax is `@media only screen and (max-width: 800px){ ... }`.
- We can use `max-width` condition expressions to trigger styles below a certain size and we can use `min-width` condition expressions to trigger styles above a certain size.
- Allow your unique content to determine at which sizes to write media query break points. Write them as you need them at whatever size your content starts to become awkward looking.
