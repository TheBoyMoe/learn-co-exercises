# Create Store Lab

## Objectives

Use the Redux __createStore()__ method to develop a React & Redux app.

## Overview

Ok, we will be building a simple React & Redux application to add new users. Just like we saw in the __createStore code along__, our application will not re-render with updates to the state. However, as some passing tests will show you, that does not mean that updates to the state are not occurring. Open up the Redux Devtools to see the changes occur, which we have already hooked up for you.

## Instructions

Run `npm install` to install the npm modules for this application. To install redux, run `npm install redux react-redux --save`. This gives you access to the createStore method. You can see that we have already applied the method, but with an empty function. Instead, write a reducer in the `reducers/manageUsers.js` file. Follow the tests to build out the proper reducer.
