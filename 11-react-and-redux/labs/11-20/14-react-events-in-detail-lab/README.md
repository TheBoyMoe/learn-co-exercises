# React Events in Detail

## Overview

In this lab, you'll work with event data and persisting events. 

## Two Buttons To Rule Them All

In this lab, you'll be working on two components â€” two buttons, to be more precise. These aren't just regular buttons, however! They both serve a very specific purpose.

### `CoordinatesButton`
1. In the `components/CoordinatesButton.js` file, create a `CoordinatesButton` React component.
2. This component takes in one prop: `onReceiveCoordinates`. This prop is a _function_. (This props is only passed in the test suite, you will have errors in the browser)
3. When the button is clicked, create an array with two elements: the X and Y coordinates of the mouse. Find these using the event data.
4. The `onReceiveCoordinates` callback prop is then called with these coordinates.

### `DelayedButton`
1. In the `components/DelayedButton.js` file, create a `DelayedButton` React component
2. This component takes two props: `onDelayedClick` (a function), and `delay` (a number). (These props are only passed in the test suite, you will have errors in the browser)
3. When the button is clicked, we want to persist the event so we can pass it to the `this.props.onDelayedClick()` in a `setTimeout()` block. The `setTimeout()` will be set to `this.props.delay`.
