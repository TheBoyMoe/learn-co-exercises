# Provider/MapStateToProps Lab

## Objectives
Use the __React Redux__ library to connect the store to the __React__ application.  
Utilize the __<Provider />__ component, and connect functions in the process.

## Overview

We will be continuing with our users application. Previously, we could update the store by submitting a form, however without the __React Redux__ library, we could not properly re-render our application components with changes to the store. Here we will use the __connect()__ function to pass updates to the store to the relevant component.

## Instructions

Use the __mapStateToProps()__ function from the __Redux__ library to properly update the __React__ application with the __Redux__ data.
