# Map Lab

## Overview
In this lab, we'll use the `map` method to write functions that properly query our data.

## Instructions
Be sure to run the tests to get a feel for the types of problems this lab is
asking you to solve.

You'll be writing three functions:
 * `lowerCaseDrivers` - this function takes an array of drivers, and returns an array of the drivers names in lowercase.
 * `nameToAttributes` - this function takes an array of drivers with their first and last name separated by a space, and returns an array of JavaScript objects with `firstName` and `lastName` attributes.
 * `attributesToPhrase` - this function takes an array of drivers as JavaScript objects and returns a string saying `"<NAME OF DRIVER> is from <HOMETOWN>"` for each JavaScript object in the array. Note that between the `<` and `>` we are looking for the value stored in the `name` and `hometown` object attributes, not the strings `"DRIVER"` or `"HOMETOWN"`.
