# Filter Lab

## Overview
In this lab, we'll use the `filter` method to write functions that properly query our data.

## Instructions
This lab contains an array of drivers with various information. We need to write methods using the `filter` method so that Scuber employees can easily query the data. Be sure to run the tests to get a feel for the types of problems this lab is asking you to solve.

You'll be writing three functions:
* `findMatching`- This function takes an array of `drivers` and a `string` as arguments, and returns the matching list of drivers. The function should be case insensitive.
* `fuzzyMatch` - This function takes an array of `drivers` and a `string` as arguments for querying the array, and returns all drivers whose names begin with the provided letters.
* `matchName` - This function takes an array of `drivers` and a `string` as arguments. In this function, each element of the `drivers` array is a JavaScript object that has a property of `name`. The function should return each element whose `name` property matches the provided `string` argument.
