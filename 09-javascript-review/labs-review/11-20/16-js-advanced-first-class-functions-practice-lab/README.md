# First-Class Functions Practice Lab

## Objectives
1. Practice using forEach
2. Practice using sort
3. Practice using reduce

## Instructions
Be sure to run the tests to get a feel for the types of problems this lab is
asking you to solve.

You'll be writing six functions:
* `logDriverNames()` — Receives an array of `driver` objects and logs the `name` attribute of each `driver` to the console.
* `logDriversByHometown()` — Receives an array of `driver` objects as the first argument and a location as the second argument. The function logs to the console the `name` attribute of each `driver` whose hometown matches the string passed in as the 'location' argument.
* `driversByRevenue()` — Receives an array of `driver` objects and returns a new array of `driver` objects sorted by their `revenue` attribute from lowest to highest.
* `driversByName()` — Receives an array of `driver` objects and returns a new array of `driver` objects sorted by their `name` attribute from A to Z. Here, you may have to use the [`String.prototype.localeCompare()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare) method.
* `totalRevenue()` — Receives an array of `driver` objects and returns the sum of the revenue earned by each driver.
* `averageRevenue()` — Receives an array of `driver` objects and returns the average revenue earned by each driver.
