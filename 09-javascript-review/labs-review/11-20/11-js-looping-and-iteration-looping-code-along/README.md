# Looping Code-along

## Objectives
- Build a `for` loop.
- Build a `while` loop.
- Explain the purpose of a loop.
- Understand when to use each type of loop.

## Introduction
Sometimes, we need to do things repeatedly. Let's say we have a bunch of gifts to wrap. They all happen to be the same size and shape, so for every gift, we need to cut a similarly sized piece of wrapping paper, fold it up over the edges of the gift, tape it together, and add a nice little card. Then we set the wrapped gift aside and moved onto the next gift.

In programming terms, we can think of our **collection** of gifts as an **array** and the act of wrapping them as a function. For example:
```js
const gifts = ['teddy bear', 'drone', 'doll'];

function wrapGift (gift) {
  console.log(`Wrapped ${gift} and added a bow!`);
}
```

We could then call `wrapGift()` on each gift individually:
```js
wrapGift(gifts[0]);
wrapGift(gifts[1]);
wrapGift(gifts[2]);
```

However, this isn't very efficient or extensible. It's a lot of repetitive code to write out, and if we had more gifts we'd have to write a whole new line for each.

This is where loops come in handy! With a loop, we can just write the repeated action **once** and perform the action on **every item in the collection**.

Loops are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of times. In JavaScript, loops come in a few different flavors, but the main two are `for` and `while` loops.

This is a code-along, so follow along with the instructions in each section. There are tests to make sure you're coding your solutions correctly.

## The `for` loop
Of the loops in JavaScript, the `for` loop is the most common. The `for` loop is made up of four statements in the following structure:
```js
for ([initialization]; [condition]; [iteration]) {
  [loop body]
}
```

- Initialization
  - Typically used to initialize a **counter** variable.
- Condition
  - An expression evaluated before each pass through the loop. If this expression evaluates to `true`, the statements in the loop body are executed. If the expression evaluates to `false`, the loop exits.
- Iteration
  - A statement executed at the end of each iteration. Typically, this will involve incrementing or decrementing a counter, bringing the loop ever closer to completion.
- Loop body
  - Code that runs on each pass through the loop.

***Usage***: Use a `for` loop when you know exactly how many times you want the loop to run (for example, when you have an array of known size).

### Examples
The code below will announce our next ten birthdays:
```js
for (let age = 30; age < 40; age++) {
  console.log(`I'm ${age} years old. Happy birthday to me!`);
}

// LOG: I'm 30 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 31 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 32 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 33 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 34 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 35 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 36 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 37 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 38 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 39 years old. Happy birthday to me!
```

In the above code, `let age = 30` is the **initialization**, as we create a variable, `age`, that we'll use in the next three phases of the loop. Notice that we use `let` instead of `const` because we need to increment the value of `age`.

The **condition** for the above loop is `age < 40`, or, in other words, "Run the code in the loop body until `age` is NOT less than `40`." As long as the condition evaluates to `true`, execute the code in the loop body, increment the value of `age`, and then reevaluate the condition. As soon as the condition evaluates to `false`, exit the loop.

The **iteration** is `age++`, which increments the value of `age` by `1` after every pass through the loop. We initialized `age` as `30`, and it retains that value during the first pass through the loop. At the end of the first pass, we increment `age` to `31`, check whether the condition still holds `true`, and, since it does, run the loop body again with `age` as `31`. After that second loop, we increment `age` to `32`, and so on.

The **loop body** is the set of statements that we want to run when the condition evaluates to `true`.

`for` loops are often used to iterate over every element in an array. Let's rewrite our gift-wrapping action above as a `for` loop:
```js
const gifts = ['teddy bear', 'drone', 'doll'];

function wrapGifts (gifts) {
  for (let i = 0; i < gifts.length; i++) {
    console.log(`Wrapped ${gifts[i]} and added a bow!`);
  }

  return gifts;
}

wrapGifts(gifts);
// LOG: Wrapped teddy bear and added a bow!
// LOG: Wrapped drone and added a bow!
// LOG: Wrapped doll and added a bow!
// => ["teddy bear", "drone", "doll"]
```

We started our counter, `i`, at `0` because arrays have zero-based indexes. Our condition states that we should run the code in the loop body while `i` is less than `gifts.length` (`3` in the above example). Our iteration, `i++`, increments our counter by `1` at the end of each pass through the loop. In our loop body, notice that we reference `gifts[i]`. Since `i` starts out as `0`, during the first pass through the loop `gifts[i]` is `gifts[0]` is `'teddy bear'`. During the second pass through the loop, `gifts[i]` is `gifts[1]` is `'drone'`. And during the final pass through the loop, `gifts[i]` is `gifts[2]` is `'doll'`. After the third pass through the loop, we increment `i` to `3`, which is no longer less than `gifts.length`. Our condition evaluates to `false`, and we exit the loop.

We'll encounter `for` loops again when we learn about iterating through object literals.

### Assignment
We're going to print out some welcome badges for new Flatbook employees. Build a function named `printBadges()` that accepts one argument, an array of employee names. Create a `for` loop with a counter that starts at `0` and increments at the end of each loop. The condition should halt the `for` loop after the last name in the array is printed out in the loop body.

Inside the loop, use `console.log()` to print out a badge for each employee, as follows:
```js
printBadges(['Ada', 'Brendan', 'Ali']);
// LOG: Welcome Ada! You are employee #1.
// LOG: Welcome Brendan! You are employee #2.
// LOG: Welcome Ali! You are employee #3.
// => ["Ada", "Brendan", "Ali"]
```

After the loop completes, have the function return the original array.

## The `while` loop
The `while` loop is similar to a `for` loop in that it will keep looping as long as the condition evaluates to `true`. However, the idea behind a `for` loop is that it should loop a set number of times (e.g., start with `i = 0` and loop while `i < 25`). A `while` loop, on the other hand, is designed to loop an indefinite amount of times — it should keep looping **while** the condition is `true` or, said differently, **until** the condition is `false`. There isn't a definite limit like "25 times" placed upon it.

A `while` loop has the following structure:
```js
while ([condition]) {
  [loop body]
}
```

***Usage***: A `while` loop is best used when we don't know how many times a loop needs to run. Often, this is because the condition depends on a dynamic value.

### Example
```js
function maybeTrue () {
  return Math.random() >= 0.5;
}

while (maybeTrue()) {
  console.log('And I ran... I ran so far away!');
}
```

In this example, `maybeTrue()` returns `true` half the time and `false` half the time. Our loop runs until `maybeTrue()` returns `false`, so, theoretically, the body of the loop might **never** run (if the first evaluation of `maybeTrue()` returns `false`) or it might run forever (if `maybeTrue()` goes on an incredible streak with `Math.random()` never returning anything below `0.5`). We've used a `while` loop because we don't have any specific number to count up or down to in our loop; we just want it to run until the condition is no longer met.

We can also use a `while` loop in place of a `for` loop. We just have to remember to make sure the condition updates with each pass through the loop so that the loop eventually terminates. Otherwise, it'll run forever, and we'll have to throw our overheating computer out the window and buy a new one. Here's an example of a `while` loop with a defined exit strategy:
```js
let countdown = 10;

while (countdown > 0) {
  console.log(--countdown);
}
```

### Assignment
We're going to create a little game for our Flatbook users to play when they're bored. Create a function named `tailsNeverFails()` that takes no arguments. In the function body, use a `while` loop with a condition that simulates a coin flip (two equally likely outcomes). For inspiration, check out the `maybeTrue()` example above. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the coin landed on 'Tails' and is flipped again. If the condition evaluates to `false`, the coin landed on 'Heads', and the 'Tails' streak is broken. At the end of the function, `return` a message to the user indicating how many times the coin landed on 'Tails' in a row, e.g.:
```js
tailsNeverFails();
// => "You got 3 tails in a row!"

tailsNeverFails();
// => "You got 0 tails in a row!"

tailsNeverFails();
// => "You got 5 tails in a row!"
```

## Conclusion
If you're feeling a bit lost about when to use a `for` vs. a `while` loop, take a deep breath. Most of the time, a regular `for` loop will suffice. It's by far the most common looping construct in JavaScript. A general heuristic for choosing which loop to use is to first try a `for` loop. If that doesn't serve your purposes, then go ahead and try a `while` or [`do...while`][do...while] loop. Also, remember that you can always refer to the [documentation on these loops][loops and iteration] at any time. After some time programming in JavaScript, writing a `for` loop will come as naturally to you as wrapping one gift after another.
