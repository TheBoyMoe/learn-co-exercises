# Creating Pets

## Objectives
+ Build constructor functions
+ Build objects with properties from a constructor function

## Intro

You work at a pet store, and it's your job to update the website with all the new animals that come into the store.

## Instructions

Create a constructor function for each of the following:
+ Dog with `name`, `breed`, and `age` properties
+ Cat with `name`, `breed`, and `age` properties
+ Ferret with `name`, `age`, and `foodRequirements` properties
+ Bird with `name` and `breed` properties
