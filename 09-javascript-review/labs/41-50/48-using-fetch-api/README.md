# JavaScript fetch()

## Overview

We'll use  `fetch()` and describe the problems that it helps solve. 

## Objectives

1. Explain how to use `fetch()` in modern browsers
2. Describe the differences between `fetch()`, `jquery.ajax()` and `XMLHttpRequest`
3. Get data from a remote endpoint using `fetch()`

## Introduction

Getting remote data in JavaScript has classically required a fair amount of plumbing to make things happen.

It's not that it's *hard* to get data out of `XMLHttpRequest`, but it does take quite a bit of setup. Let's make a simple request of the GitHub repository commits API.

```js
let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', 'https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/commits');
xhr.responseType = 'json';

xhr.onload = function() {
  console.log(xhr.response);
};

xhr.onerror = function() {
  console.log('Booo');
};

xhr.send();
```

Sure, it works, but that's a lot of setup to just say "give me some JSON from this URL".

I mean, you could just crack an egg and start cooking it, you know? Similarly, I'll never understand why we have to call `open` and then call `send`. Or why we can only set headers *after* we call `open`. Or any number of other clunky ways we have to use XHR.

Things get a little better with jQuery's `$.ajax`, except then we have to tightly couple ourselves to jQuery, and ultimately, it's just syntactic sugar over `XMLHttpRequest`.

XHR also abstracts away our ability to work directly with the request and response objects, limiting our ability to do more advanced things on an internet that's evolved far beyond just XML and HTTP.

**Note:** To be fair to XHR, it can handle more protocols than HTTP and more formats than XML, but it was never designed with the level of interconnectedness of today's programs in mind. For instance, streaming, a staple of the modern web, isn't possible when you can only access `responseText` after the request has completed.

Wouldn't it be nice if there were a sleek new API designed from the ground up to handle the needs of the modern web?

## fetch()

The `fetch()` function is a new API for fetching resources. It's a global function, which means no creating new XHR objects, and it vastly streamlines simple resource requests. Let's try that call to the GitHub commits API again.

```js
fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/commits')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(json => console.log(json));
```

I know, right? Let's break it down.

Since we're making a simple `GET` request, we can just pass the URL directly to `fetch`. But what's happening next?

### Promises and then

In JavaScript, a `Promise` object represents a value that may not be available yet, but will be resolved at some point in the future. Essentially, the promise is an object that represents the result of an operation, whenever it occurs. This allows us to write more flexible asynchronous code than simply passing callback functions to asynchronous functions.

All promises implement a `then` function that is called when the promise is *fulfilled*, or completed successfully. So this is very similar to the idea of a callback on success that we'd use with `XMLHttpRequest` or `$.ajax`.

The interesting thing about this `fetch` code is that it highlights a powerful feature of a `thenable` object — we can chain each `then` call, and the next one receives the result of the previous one as its argument.

So, in this code:

```js
fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/commits')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(json => console.log(json));
```

the line `then(res => res.json())` is getting the response `res` from `fetch` and using the `json` method (more on this in a bit) to turn it into JSON. Then it's passing the JSON to the next line, `then(json => console.log(json))`, to be handled by that function.

### Body Mixin

The `fetch` API includes a *mixin*, or additional code, called [Body](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch#Body), which has functions that specialize in transforming the `body` of a request or response.

In an `XMLHttpRequest`, you would potentially have to `JSON.parse` the `responseText` data to turn it into JSON. The `Body` mixin takes that a step further, giving us handy ways to parse many formats, including JSON, plain text, and even blobs for binary or image data.

So calling `res.json()` in our `fetch` is just a nice shorthand for saying "give me the `body` of the response parsed as JSON".

## Authenticated Fetching

So far, we've been making our requests against the public API functions that GitHub provides, but there are more powerful toys available to us if we can prove to the API who we are when we make requests.

### OAuth

GitHub's API uses [OAuth2](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/) for authorization. In a production setting, you would register an application with GitHub and receive an application ID and secret. This allows GitHub to track and monitor API access, and ensure that its users are protected by only granting authorization through registered apps.

From there, a user would make a request via your app, which would kick off the workflow to issue an authorization code that your app would then exchange for an access token. The access token is ultimately what your application includes in GitHub API requests to identify and authorize the user.

Setting up the full OAuth2 authorization code grant workflow is beyond the scope of this lesson, but it is described well in the GitHub [docs](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/).

Fortunately for us, GitHub also allows you to generate your own personal authorization token that we can use to give us authorized access to the API. And `fetch` makes it super easy to implement.

To start, go to [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and click "Generate new token." Name it "Learn.co" and check `repo` scope. Once you generate the token, make sure to copy and paste it somewhere, because once you leave that page, you won't be able to see it again. This is for your security — even if someone were to gain access to this page on your account, they still couldn't see your tokens.

Using the token to [access the API](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#3-use-the-access-token-to-access-the-api) is a simple matter of creating an `Authorization` header with our request. Let's try it out by listing our repos.

```js
fetch('https://api.github.com/user/repos').
  then(res => res.json()).
  then(json => console.log(json))
```

If we run that code, we'll get a `401 (Unauthorized)` response. We need to provide our authorization token in order to list our own repositories with this API, so let's add our `Authorization` header (don't forget to assign your token to `const token`).

```js
const token = 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
fetch('https://api.github.com/user/repos', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `token ${token}`
  }
}).then(res => res.json()).then(json => console.log(json));
```

We just pass the desired headers as part of a second options argument to `fetch` and we are in business. Easy as that!

**Top-Tip:** Don't ever give out your access token or store it in a publicly accessible place or a shared GitHub repository. We're just using these for learning purposes. In a production setting, users' access tokens would be stored securely in a database and not exposed to other people.

## Caveat Browser

As you can see, `fetch` provides us with such a clean, low-maintenance way to fetch and work with resources. You may be wondering why you'd ever use XHR again.

Keep in mind that, while it is increasing, [browser support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch) for `fetch` is still limited primarily to current versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. So if you're supporting older browsers, don't let XHR and jQuery Ajax go just yet. They're still powerful and useful tools for creating dynamic applications.
