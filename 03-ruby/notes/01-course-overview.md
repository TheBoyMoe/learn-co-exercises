## What You'll Learn 

You’ll learn the fundamentals of procedural and object oriented Ruby and reinforce your learning throughout by cumulatively building a Tic Tac Toe command line application game. In this way you’ll learn how to think like a programmer and structurally break down complicated problems into smaller component. Below is a general overview of what's covered. You'll notice that many of the concepts below will look familiar to you as you've already covered them in the Javascript units. 

## Debugging
- Debug Ruby Programs using IRB
- Explain how to debug code by running tests and solving error messages
- Identify four common types of error messages

## Variables and Arrays
- Create and declare variables
- List and create the six data types in Ruby
- Create and manipulate arrays

## Methods
- Create methods that take in single, multiple, and no arguments
- Return values from methods
- Read and describe the various parts of error messages in tests

## Command Line Applications
- Define command line applications as programs that interact directly with the computer’s shell and terminal
- Describe the file structure of a CLI
- Capture user input in a CLI 
- Build a simple CLI

## Logic and Conditionals
- Use conditional statements and comparison operators to control the flow of a program

## Loops and Iteration
- Use looping to tell a program to perform a repetitive action
- Build methods using `while` and `until` loops
- Distinguish between looping and iteration
- Iterate over arrays using boolean enumerators (#all?, #none?, #any?, #include?)
- Iterate over arrays using search enumerators (#select, #detect, #reject)
- Create and iterate over nested arrays

## Object Orientation
- Describe Ruby classes and create instances of a class
- Call and build instance methods on an object
- Distinguish between instance and local variables
- Explain how instance variables give objects attributes and properties
- Define methods that read and write to instance variables
- Create object properties using methods and instance variables
- Build and use setter and getter methods
- Instantiate instances of classes
